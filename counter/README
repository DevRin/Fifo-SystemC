This is a SystemC example of a simple counter.

To build and run the example do the following steps: 
 
1. Set an environment variable SYSTEMC to SystemC installation directory:

	> export SYSTEMC=/opt/systemc/systemc-2.3.1

3. make a directory build in the top level directory of counter example

	> mkdir build

4. Go to the directory build 

	> cd build

5. Build it
	
	> cmake .. 

This will generate standard UNIX makefiles.
Goto step 6.

Otherwise to generate eclipse and Kdevelop projects add -G to cmake command:

        > cmake -G "Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles" .. for eclipse projects

        > cmake -G  KDevelop3 .. for KDevelop projects

Import projects in resp. environment (look at opt/example/Screenshots folder)

6. To compile the example do:

       
        > make  

       
7. To run example, go to the folder build/src and do: 

        > ./run
